==== Sell.do concurrent and parallel programming multithreading semophore @service and @component , are they create singleton class. when to use linkedlist and when to use array list java8 Concurrency means that two or more calculations happen within the same time frame, and there is usually some sort of dependency between them.

Parallelism means that two or more calculations happen simultaneously.

Put boldly, concurrency describes a problem (two things need to happen together), while parallelism describes a solution (two processor cores are used to execute two things simultaneously).

Parallelism is one way to implement concurrency, but it's not the only one. Another popular solution is interleaved processing (a.k.a. coroutines): split both tasks up into atomic steps, and switch back and forth between the two.
